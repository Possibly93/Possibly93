      A distribution and support BBS for SIO has been setup.  The
      number is 1-703-494-0098.  The modem is a 16.8 USR Dual Standard. 
      SIO users can register on line and immediately download their
      registered version of SIO.  Use the ORDER command at the main BBS
      menu.  Previously registered users that wish to increase their
      number of ports can also place an ORDER and download immediately.

      Registered users,  be sure to have your SIO serial number the
      first time that you call the BBS, it will speed things up.  Note
      that those that registered SIO prior to 1.20 were not given a
      serial number.  A serial number will be assigned upon request.

      Once in the BBS data base knows you as a registered user, the
      BBS's UPDATE command can be used to obtain a new registered copy
      of SIO at any time.  All "number of ports" versions of SIO are
      available to registered users for immediate updating and
      downloading.  Users that accidently overlay their registered
      version of SIO can also use the UPDATE command to obtain a
      replacement registered copy of SIO.  If you use the BBS's UPDATE
      command THEN YOU DO NOT NEED TO RUN REREG.

      Users that have a registered copy of SIO can also use REREG.EXE
      to transfer the registration information to a new version of SIO. 
      Simply unzip the new SIO files into a temporary directory, change
      to that directory, execute REREG and answer the questions.  After
      doing the above, all of the files in the temporary directory will
      have been registered.  You must then copy all the SYS and EXE
      files from the temporary directory to their normal directory
      (overlaying the old registered version).  Then you must reboot. 
      You may also want to check your CONFIG.SYS for the path of the
      SIO/VSIO being loaded and make sure both the new ones are being
      loaded.

      If REREG will not transfer your registration information from a
      previous version of SIO to the new version, then an upgrade must
      be ordered on disk or obtained from the support BBS.
