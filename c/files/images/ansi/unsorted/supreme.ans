Just a note about the files included in this Archive.

During the course of running a Bulletin Board every SYSOP has come in contact
with some form of ANSI Drawing Program.  I like a lot of other people could not
draw anything with any kind of program.  Fortunately for me I met a young man
by the name of James Herring, and have marveled at his talent for art, and for
computers.

We have included some examples of his work in this archive.  Feel free to
distribute this file.....as a matter of fact.....PLEASE distribute this file.


NOW FOR THE GOOD PART.......if you are like I am and can't draw even with an
Ansi drawing program, then all you have to do is call a certain number and we
will share the talents of James Herring.  You can call:
