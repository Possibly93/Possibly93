Repeat ANSIs
------------
    Repeat ANSIs are a feature probably only known to people who have used 
Oblivion/2.  It is a very simple, yet powerful way to make your BBS 
configurable.  For example, to make a Last Callers ANSI in Eternity you would
simply make 3 ANSIs:  LASTTOP.ANS, LASTMID.ANS, and LASTBOT.ANS.  These three
ansis would contain the following:
LASTTOP.ANS - This file would contain the top of the ANSI, it will be displayed
              first.  At the end of this file, it is logical to have an EOF
              (end-of-file) marker so that Eternity knows not to print an
              extra line or two.  Therefore, at the end of the last line of
              your header, you need to put an EOF marker.  This is done by
              pressing Ctrl-Z or Alt-26.  Usually, however, you must either
              press Ctrl-P or Ctrl-Q first.

              For example, in MS-DOS edit, to place an EOF marker on a file,
              press Ctrl-P, Ctrl-Z.  This will make a little arrow that points
              to the right.  In some weird editors, such as the technical
              editor v2.5, you need to press Ctrl-Q instead of Ctrl-P.
              If you have the PC-DOS editor (E.EXE) which comes with PC-DOS
              6.2 or 7.0, press Alt-X instead of Ctrl-P.
              
LASTMID.ANS - This is the most complicated of the three ANSIs.  Generally it 
              contains one or more OPTEXT (OT for short) MCI codes.  The
              middle file of the ansi is displayed XX amount of times until
              you have reached the number of times you want to display 
              information.  Check below for a list of OT codes.
              
LASTBOT.ANS - This file would contain the bottom of the ansi, it will be 
              displayed last.
        When Eternity is run, it would then piece these three ANSIs together.
When viewed they appear as one whole ansi, displaying the information
(in this case, last callers), XX amount of times so the ANSI looks whole and
no one can tell the difference! :)
