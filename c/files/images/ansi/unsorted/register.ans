Registering Eternity v1.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you use this software and think that it's worth $15, please take the time
and small amount of money to register this software.  Even though registration
is not required, it is appreciated.  I have put a lot of work into Eternity,
and although I'm not expecting everyone to register, it would be nice if some
people would -- especially you.

You get the following benefits from registering Eternity:

  1) Registration is only $15.  This price may go up later.
  2) You will never need to register again.
  3) You get to be a member of EternalNet, if you wish.
  4) You get unlimited technical support.
  5) Other benefits, not listed here.
  6) You have the satisfaction knowing that you have registered.  <grin>


If you want to register Eternity, please send $15 cash or money order to:

Isaac Oates
26 Atlantis Ter
Freehold, NJ
         07728 


Make sure you print out REGISTER.FRM and fill it out if at all possible --
otherwise, just copy it out onto a piece of paper (especially the contract
part.)

To find out more information about registering Eternity, give Eternal Tech
a call at 908-866-0551.
