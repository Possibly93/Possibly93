Usage of Menu Editor
To create commands that are at any menu, create a menu called GLOBAL.MNU,
those commands will be at every menu.
There are several possibilities for the menu types
In the Pulldown Filename, there can be the following:
  <blank>
    Draws Menu Prompt with the name in the prompt in the prompt and does
      standard input
  ::X
    where X is a letter in the alphabet
    Puts as the input a character from A to the X character randomly
  N
    Writes the Name in the Prompt alone
      with
        ^R - Regular Color
        ^S - Status Color
        ^P - Prompt Color
        ^E - Input Color
        ^V - Inverse Color
        ^X - Box Color
        ^M - Goes down a line
      there are possibilities for the ending character
        / Yes/No Bar Prompt beginning with No
        \ Yes/No Bar Prompt beginning with Yes
        = Yes/No/Quit Bar Prompt Beginning with Yes
        | Yes/No/Quit Bar Prompt Beginning with No
        @ Yes/No/Quit Bar Prompt Beginning with Quit
        * Inputs String
        : Inputs String with a : in a different color
        # Gets one character
        ) Gets one character and echos it if its a low-ASCII character
        ( Sets the string equal to the Input Question varaible set with
          -I or -H)
  Bx
    Does Bar selection menu with x number of columns
  <filename.ext>
    Reads in the filename in the textfile directory with |XX marking the
    color and position of option number XX when it is not highlighted and
    %XX marking the color of the option when highlighted
    Option numbers are assigned with the Pulldown ID,
    when stacking commands, when the option is selected with the pulldown
    bar, the input character is set to the key, so if you need to stack commands,
    only give a pulldown ID to the first option in the stack
  There is wildcarding for menu commands:
    If you set the Key to X*, then you can put * in the Cstring and that will
    put what follows the X in the Cstring.
    This is advisable for such cases as file conference jumping such as
    J* with would do JM with a Cstring of * so one could J1,J2, etc.
  Also a possibility for CString is & in which is set to the input gotten
  with -I, -H, or set with -*.

  CMD  : [F
