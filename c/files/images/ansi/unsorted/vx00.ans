          VX00.SYS is a DOS device driver and has no parameters.  It must
          be installed using the DOS_DEVICE setting for selected DOS tasks. 
          If you desire VX00.SYS loaded for all DOS sessions, then load it
          in your OS/2 CONFIG.SYS.

          VX00.SYS is little more than a software interface to SIO,
          providing FOSSIL based programs with direct access to the real
          comm driver SIO.SYS.  This direct access allows FOSSIL based
          programs to bypass the virtualization and the associated
          processor time that virtualization eats up.  Your FOSSIL based
          programs should now require far less of the processor's time.

          There are no options or utilities for VX00.SYS.  DO NOT use X00's
          XU with VX00.SYS, it will not work correctly.  VX00.SYS has no
          buffers to make larger or smaller, it uses the same buffers that
          SIO.SYS uses;  DOS programs or device drivers can not lock/unlock
          the baud rate, only SIO.SYS can do that.  There should be no need
          to turn off the FOSSIL or to uninstall it.

          Try VX00.SYS before assuming that you need to do things the same
          old way that it was done with X00 or another FOSSIL.  All of the
          rules have changed for DOS comm when executing under OS/2.
