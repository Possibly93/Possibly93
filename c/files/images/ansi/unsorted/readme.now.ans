-[ Impulse 3.5 Release Notes ]-

This is a relatively bare release in the terms of ansi and such.  I've come
to a good conclusion that the ANSI is the job of the sysop, or the actual
job of his to take care of.  Very few ansi will be included in any following
releases of Impulse Host System.  Feel free to make and distribute menu sets
as you see fit, but i see no reason for me to provide them.  This choice
allows a wider range of bbs options out there.  If you haven't noticed, all
obv boards look the same, no matter how they're configured. :)

Thanks VERY VERY much to Ogre.  He provides me with an FTP site to place this
thing at.  Without him, distrobution would be half of what it currently is.

Be on the lookout for IMP35DEV.ZIP.  This is the Impulse Development Kit i have
made for those "coders" out there who wish to write external programs and
utils for my wonderful software.  It contains all Records types, and even demo
procedures and functions to get you going on the right track.  And last but
not least, it includes the Impulse COMM Library.  This is the actually unit
i used for impulse's fabulous comm routines.  Have fun.

NOTE:  To all Utility/External Authors.  Depending on the quality of your
       contribution to Impulse, your support will be rewarded with my support.
       If i like what you've done.  BOOM, Free Registration.
