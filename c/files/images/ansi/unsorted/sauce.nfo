                      SAUCE Implementation Information 

SAUCE can very easily be added to Oblivion/2 with the ADDSAUCE.EXE utility.  
One simply runs ADDSAUCE.EXE to create the appropriate batch files and 
archiver record.  For information on changing your SAUCE configuration, refer
to SAUCEPAN.NFO and HISTORY.DOC.
