     SLOOSE    (Sl-OOOOZ): n: The point of contact between the human
                backside and the aircraft in the little room away aft in
                said airplane. v: to dump the contents of said sloose
                upon unsuspecting sysops.
                SLOOSEY: adj: Pertaining to a sloose. Having similar
                characteristics to a sloose.


 
Webster's Dictionary:
 
     SLUICE: n. 1. An artificial channel or passage for water, having a

                   by or passing through such a gate.  3. Any channel,
                   especially one for excess water.
 



08/20/89 11:55 MAJOR Mike

open air sloose! Sheesh!

FROM: MAJOR    Mike
TO:   ALL      
SMRY: 

didja all know that this is National Elvis Week?  Saw the ol' boy again
on my way to the orient when I was over the Bering Strait at 42,000.
Seems he was a might pissed cause I changed direction  of travel on him an'
he had to make some smoke to catch up with me. (wrong end of the
continent and all that). Anyhoo, he wants me to remind y'all that this
week being his an' all, that he plans to make a comeback mighty soon.
He's been a might peeved that nobody responded to his posts on here, so
y'all better start sending some fan mail soon or the ol' boy just may
desert us!
since he had to move fast, he left Roy Orbeson behind, seein' as ol' Roy
can't navigate too good in the dark or otherwise, and naturally the Big
Bopper was carryin' a few too many lbs to make weights and balances so
he stayed behind too. Kinda missed seein' the two of them. Buddy Holly
mighta come along, but he was doin' a gig with Richie Valens at the VFW
hall in Toledo. Seems they was recruited special for that to celebrate
the Mud Hen's only win of the season to date...

Elvis was mighty envious too, about Bobby's new Tennesee Toothpick.
Kinda liked the built in video instructions that came with it. Seems
he's been a watchin' Bobby practice with it. Says Bobby outta learn to
keep his head down and his left arm a little straighter when he swings,
tho...

Guess I musta made me a friend of Elvis, cuz' this was the first time he
came into the aircraft instead of just perchin' on the nose cone. Course
it coulda been that he needed to use the Sloose. He did disappear aft
for a minute or two, and I did get a couple of inquiries from the stews
about something to do with Las Vegas. Guess dying musta been pretty good
to Elvis cuz' he's lost a few pounds along the way, so when he does show
up, everyone figgers he's an impersonator..

Well, that's about all I got for this Elvis update... Y'all start
sending in them cards and letters now y'hear?!


08/16/89 08:52 WILD Wally
Just a question, Mike. HOW did you get started with this ? I know you
have been under a strain lately, but really!!


08/16/89 09:25 BOBBY Bob
Project Blue Book is still looking for Mike.. they have a few
questions... And how'd Elvis know about the bruise on the side o' my
head from keeping my arm bent?????  (Theme from twilight zone playing
distantly in background)


08/16/89 12:12 MAJOR Mike
Dontcha know Bobby, that Elvis looks out fer his own?


08/16/89 13:56 WILD Wally
<shaking head...>


08/16/89 19:49 MAJOR Mike
SHEESH!


08/16/89 21:13 BOBBY Bob
Sorry Wally.. gonna have to side with Mike on this one... If he says
there's someone up there looking out for me, well.. I aint about to look
a gift-Elvis in the mouth!


08/17/89 03:33 SYSOP The Boss
<shaking head>


08/17/89 05:19 MAJOR Mike
Atta Way, Bobby! Just y'all remember what I told you the other night....

     Don't Re-fuel!

Seen Elvis again early this AM a hoverin' outside my hotel window..
wanted me to tell ya how he watched ya practicing with yer toothpick and
he says yer doin' better on keepin' yer head low, and that arm is in
better form. Did say though that ya should watch out for your backswing
a little, and that ya should wrap real tight on yer follow thru!


08/17/89 07:22 BOBBY Bob
haha!!!  Yeah! I damn near put the thing through the dang-blasted
picture window!  Elvis forgot to mention "Stay away from fragile
expensive obejects"!  Ask him next time what he thinks about my going on
to the one handed fancy stuff once I've gotten down the two handed
swings!...  As fer the follow through... I've had to cut it shy less'n I
lose me a picture tube!


08/17/89 11:34 MAJOR Mike
Elvis recommends that if'n your aiming to hit low that ya adopt a decent
stance and turn into the swing. If y'all are planning on hittin' hi then
it's better to use the Michigan axe approach...


08/17/89 14:28 WILD Wally
<still shaking head..>


08/17/89 17:00 BOBBY Bob
hahaha!! Wally better be careful around these parts... he's bound to
hurt his neck!  (kidding)   I wuz just aiming to hit bout face level is
all... (But with the picture window in the way.. it gets a bit hairy!)


08/17/89 22:34 MAJOR Mike
Ya don't try for the hairy part Bobby! That there's the padded section!
sheesh!


08/17/89 23:52 BOBBY Bob
hahaha.... boooo!   (Least I won't shake my head!)  Geeze!  With all the
head shaking goin' on around these parts, you'd think we were at
Wimbeldon or something!


08/18/89 02:47 SYSOP The Boss
Bob won't shake his head 'cause he's afraid the extra motion will cause
a few more hairs to fall out!


08/18/89 05:43 MAJOR Mike
Shake rattle an' ROLL!

 By the way, Elvis told me ag'in this AM how mighty diappointed he is
that he ain't gettin' no fan mail outta this gig. Seems he was Lonesome
Tonite so somewhere along the course of the evening he replaced the sign
on the Ariaiko Hotel so it says Heartbreak Hotel now. Says if'n folks
don't wanna send him no mail from here, then he'll just see if he can
find Lou Gherig and borrow his bat to go huntin' with me an Bobby when
I gets back to the states.. Wanted me to ask ya Bobby if yer out lookin'
fer a hound fer yerself, if'n ya wouldn't keep an eye peeled for one fer
him as well.. he ain't fussy... jest don't get one that's a cryin' all the
time. Y'hear?


08/18/89 09:44 BOBBY Bob
Loud and clear!  We don't want any o' dem wimpy hounds on the hunt!
Tell him to find Old Yeller... I hear he was a might strong cooner in
his day!


08/18/89 11:25 MAJOR Mike
Elvis is partial, I think, to them ugly bloodhound types. Keep an eye
peeled!


08/18/89 14:25 BOBBY Bob
Sho' thing!
/


08/18/89 19:12 RANDY Randall
What be y'all hunt'n fo'?


08/18/89 23:25 MAJOR Mike
If'n you gotta ask that question, then you don't read these posts from
stem to stern, that's fer sure!


08/19/89 04:28 BOBBY Bob
Less'n he's an Evelyn Wood groupie!


08/19/89 10:09 MAJOR Mike
Ain't too hard to speed read around here the way this has been crawlin'
up the screen lately!


08/19/89 13:44 BOBBY Bob
hahahaha!!!  Sho' nuff' no speed reading tickets to be given out here!


08/19/89 19:27 MAJOR Mike
le's all move down south where there ain't no speed limits!



08/20/89 01:40 BOBBY Bob
Just dirt roads! hahaha!!! (Six of one, half a dozen of another!)


08/20/89 11:54 MAJOR Mike
guess'n we all better git us a 4 by....


08/20/89 20:26 BOBBY Bob
How y'all s'posed to keep the dog in the back on bumps like that?!


08/21/89 06:17 MAJOR Mike
chain him to the bumper..


08/21/89 10:22 BOBBY Bob
Is that why they howl the way they do?  Never would'a figgered! haha!


08/21/89 13:37 MAJOR Mike
Only do that if'n they bounce outta the back when yer on the move...


08/21/89 14:35 BOBBY Bob
Leave a neat stripe down the middle of the road tho'...


08/22/89 03:04 SYSOP The Boss
So that's what happened to Old Yella!


08/22/89 07:13 MAJOR Mike
