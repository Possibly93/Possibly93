Oblivion/2 v2.25 Release - 06/19/94
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes folks, the release of Oblivion/2 v2.25 is finally here. It's been LONG
overdue. This release adds a myriad of new features as well as fixing bugs
from previous versions. For a complete listing of changes from v2.10, please
read HISTORY.DOC. Some of the major changes include:

        -- DATAMAIL.EXE utility written to allow networking of any data
           area. You can now echo BBS Lists, Rumors, or any data area
           between boards.
        -- Increased speed and effiency for OBVMAIL.EXE.
        -- You can now create QWK packets by using date constraints.
        -- Scrollable file listings. (Similar to a file listing in PCBoard)
        -- You can now make generic menus. These menus are automatically
           updated by the BBS whenever you add or change a menu command.
        -- The deleted list gives the SysOp total control of who's not
           welcome on the system.
        -- Obv/2 can optionally create a file catalog to aid in quick
           searches and duplicate checking.
        -- RIP Graphics support and auto-detection.
        -- RIP Mouse Support.
        -- .REP packet duplicate checking.
        -- Special Login option allows you to completely customize your
           BBS's login sequence.
        -- Multiple Infoform Sets - Allow you to have more than 5 infoforms.
        -- Unlimited file description size.
        -- Support for 28.8k modems, includes 115,200bps port locking.
        -- Improved ACS parser.
        -- Support for SAUCE ansi comments.
        -- E-Mail Tags (See HISTORY.DOC)
        -- Improved documentation with sections on OS/2 setup, ANSI.SYS,
           and creating ansis.
        -- New menu commands for added flexibility.
        -- More configurable screens for the custom look.

For more information on certain features, please consult HISTORY.DOC.

There are a few things about the software that you should know before you
proceed any further.

This version was due out a long time ago. Due to conflicts with time and
resources, it was delayed. We do NOT like this at all, and I'm sure you as
SysOps don't either. We're sorry for the long delay. As the saying goes,
"The best come to those who wait."

In the future, we'll be releasing periodic maintenance updates of the BBS
to registered SysOps. These updates will fix minor bugs, and add new
features. Periodic maintenance releases should insure that everyone is
running a current version of the BBS at all times.

With this version, you will need a new serial number. These are made
available to registered sysops on the Fringes. If you cannot find your
validator, please leave me (Lord Tracer) mail about it, and we'll correct
the problem.

Due to the numerous fake releases of v2.20, that version has been skipped.
The new version number is 2.25. We'd like to thank all responsible parties
for the fake releases. Thanks for being stupid.

There have been many sysops coming to me and asking about beta sites. After
this version is released, all current beta sites are going to be re-evaluated.
If they don't participate in beta discussions, and call the Fringes regularly,
their beta access will be revoked. We will be accepting new beta sites
after this evaluation is done. In order for you to qualify, you must be a
member of ImpactNet, and call the Fringes regularly. When it comes to beta
testing, there are no free rides.

During the 2.20 beta testing period, there were NUMEROUS beta leaks. We're
working on a solution to help stop this problem. If you are caught
distributing any beta versions of Oblivion/2, your registration will be
REVOKED. No questions asked. NO EXCEPTIONS.

To clear up some misconceptions about registration, there are NO area code
limits. All that we ask of prospective applicants is that they have an
already registered sysop vouch for their system. If this is a problem,
please send mail to me (Lord Tracer) on the Fringes.

Many people should be thanked for this release. Here are a few that deserve
extra special thanks:

BeerBum    - Your constant suggestions and detailed bug reports helped make
             things much easier.
DeLuxe     - Your documentation additions were excellent.
Farmicus   - The RIP setup looks great. Thanks for your hard work.

And of course the many others who are too numerous to mention, but have not
been forgotten.

I'd once again like to thank you for checking out Oblivion/2. I'm sure that
you'll find the new additions and changes will make the BBS system much
friendlier for you and your users.
